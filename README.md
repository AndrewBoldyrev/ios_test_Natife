# Test task for the position of an iOS Developer

## Installing Dependencies

Now we're going to integrate our libraries into the Xcode project.

- Close Xcode Project
- Open Terminal
- Enter command `cd ~/path/to/your/project`
- Enter command `pod install`

> Wait for this to finish, depending on the requirements of the `Podfile`, particularly with new projects, this may take a minute or two.  Just leave it.

When cocoapods is done installing libraries, you will get a terminal readout that says:

>[!] From now on use `<#Your Project#>.xcworkspace`.

Follow this instruction and henceforth, **use the workspace** instead of your project.
